#query
MLDv2
   In order to maintain protocol robustness, queries defined in the
   Actions column of the table below need to be transmitted [Last
   Listener Query Count] times, once every [Last Listener Query
   Interval] period.

   Query       Action
   -----       ------
   Q(MA,A)     Source Timers for sources in A are lowered to LLQT
   Q(MA)       Filter Timer is lowered to LLQT

 7.6.3.1.  Building and Sending Multicast Address Specific Queries

   When a table action "Send Q(MA)" is encountered, the Filter Timer
   must be lowered to LLQT.  The Querier must then immediately send a
   Multicast Address Specific query as well as schedule [Last Listener
   Query Count - 1] query retransmissions to be sent every [Last
   Listener Query Interval], over [Last Listener Query Time].

   When transmitting a Multicast Address Specific Query, if the Filter
   Timer is larger than LLQT, the "Suppress Router-Side Processing" bit
   is set in the query message.

 7.6.3.2.  Building and Sending Multicast Address and Source Specific
          Queries

   When a table action "Send Q(MA,X)" is encountered by the Querier in
   the table in section 7.4.2, the following actions must be performed
   for each of the sources in X that send to multicast address MA, with
   source timer larger than LLQT:

   o  Lower source timer to LLQT;

   o  Add the sources to the Retransmission List;

   o  Set the Source Retransmission Counter for each source to [Last
      Listener Query Count].

   The Querier must then immediately send a Multicast Address and Source
   Specific Query as well as schedule [Last Listener Query Count -1]
   query retransmissions to be sent every [Last Listener Query
   Interval], over [Last Listener Query Time].  The contents of these
   queries are calculated as follows.

   When building a Multicast Address and Source Specific Query for a
   multicast address MA, two separate query messages are sent for the
   multicast address.  The first one has the "Suppress Router-Side
   Processing" bit set and contains all the sources with retransmission
   state (i.e., sources from the Retransmission List of that multicast
   address), and timers greater than LLQT.  The second has the "Suppress
   Router-Side Processing" bit clear and contains all the sources with
   retransmission state and timers lower or equal to LLQT.  If either of
   the two calculated messages does not contain any sources, then its
   transmission is suppressed.

   Note: If a Multicast Address Specific query is scheduled to be
   transmitted at the same time as a Multicast Address and Source
   specific query for the same multicast address, then transmission of
   the Multicast Address and Source Specific message with the "Suppress
   Router-Side Processing" bit set may be suppressed.

   o  Lower source timer to LLQT;
   o  Add the sources to the Retransmission List;
   o  Set the Source Retransmission Counter for each source to [Last
      Listener Query Count].

      The query has the "Suppress Router-Side
   Processing" bit set and contains all the sources with retransmission
   state
      The second has the "Suppress
   Router-Side Processing" bit clear and contains all the sources with
   retransmission state and timers lower or equal to LLQT.

#downward compatibility
 - In the Presence of MLDv1 Routers
    - querier musst use the lowest version of MLD present on the network.
      - administraively assured
 - In the Presence of MLDv1 Multicast Address Listeners 
      - MLDv2 Routers must operatin v1 compatibility mode
      - the Comp_mode_var is set to MLDv1 whenever an MLDV1 listener report is received
          per Multicast address, (start "Older Version Host Present Timer")
        - ist der timer abgelaufen wird zur√ºck nach MLDv2 geswitched und und erst nach
            einem Multicast Address Listening Interval werden wieder source geblockt

                       MLDv1 Message                 MLDv2 Equivalent

                          Done                          TO_IN( {} )

    MLDv2 BLOCK messages are ignored (i.e., any TO_EX() message is treated as TO_EX( {} ))
