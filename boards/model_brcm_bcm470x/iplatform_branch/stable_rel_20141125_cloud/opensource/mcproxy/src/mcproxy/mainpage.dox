 * \section Introduction
 * Mcproxy is an IGMP/MLD Proxy daemon for Linux.
 * 
 * IGMP/MLD proxies offer the possibility to combine local
 * multicast networks with a larger multicast infrastructure. In 
 * contrast to multicast routers, proxies are lightweight and do 
 * not require the support of a multicast routing protocols such as PIM or 
 * DVMRP. A common use case are local stub networks that interconnect with a 
 * remote multicast routing domain, possibly via a tunnel. Another usage
 * example is in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6 - RFC 5213) 
 * domains that want to provide transparent multicast services for 
 * mobile nodes. The mcproxy meets the requirements of the IGMP/MLD 
 * proxy standard (RFC 4605) and has additional functionalities. The 
 * multicast proxy can be instantiated multiple times and is dynamically 
 * configurable at runtime.
 *
 * \section Overview Overview
 *
 * \par 
 * The mcproxy is divided into the modules Receiver, Routing, Timer, 
 * Sender and an  arbitrary number of Proxy-Instances.

 *
 * \par
 * The module @ref mod_proxy reads the configuration file on startup. It then configures 
 * and starts all other modules, acquire the mrt-flag on a socket for
 * manipulating the multicast routing tables of the Linux kernel.
 *
 * \par
 * A @ref mod_proxy_instance represents a full multicast proxy. Each instance 
 * has access to the modules Receiver, Routing, Sender and Timer.
 *
 * \par
 * The module @ref mod_sender generates and sends Membership Queries to the 
 * downstreams and Membership Reports to the upstreams.
 *
 * \par
 * The module @ref mod_receiver uses the socket with the mrt-flag to receive Membership 
 * Reports and Cache Miss messages. Cache Miss messages are sent from the 
 * Linux kernel in order to inform proxies about new multicast sources.
 *
 * \par
 * The module @ref mod_routing sets and deletes virtual interfaces and multicast 
 * forwarding rules.
 * 
 * \par
 * The module @ref mod_timer organizes the temporal behavior of the Proxy-Instances.
 * 
 * \subsection Communication Communication between the modules
 *

 * 
 * \par
 * The modules communicate via synchronized message queues with the Proxy-Instances.
 *
 * \par
 * Proxy-Instances register their interfaces at the module Receiver. 
 * If a Membership Report or a Cache Miss massage arrives at on of this 
 * regestrated interafaces, the module Receiver  sends a message to the 
 * relevant Proxy-Instance.
 *
 * \par
 * Proxy-Instances add reminders to the module Timer. A reminder contains a time
 * and a message. If the predefined time expires for a reminder, the module Timer 
 * retun the reminder to the relevant Proxy-Instance. In this way, the temporal behavior
 * of the Proxy-Instances is controlled.
 *
 * \par
 * All other modules only waits for instructions from the Proxy-Instances.
