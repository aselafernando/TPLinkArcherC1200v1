SIGNING:
 $ gpg -a -b [file]

VERIFY SIGNATURE:
We sign easy-rsa packages with a GPG private key.  The public key is available
in the git repository (PUBLIC_KEY) as well as on various GPG/PGP public key
servers around the net.

To verify the package signature download and import our public key into GPG:
  $ gpg --import pubkey.txt
Then download and verify the signature:
  $ gpg -v --verify [file].asc
Note that the [file].asc and tarball need to be in the same directory.
