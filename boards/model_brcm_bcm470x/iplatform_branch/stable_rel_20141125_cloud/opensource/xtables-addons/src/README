Xtables-addons
==============

Xtables-addons is the proclaimed successor to patch-o-matic(-ng). It
contains extensions that were not accepted in the main Xtables
package.

Xtables-addons is different from patch-o-matic in that you do not
have to patch or recompile either kernel or Xtables(iptables). But
please see the INSTALL file for the minimum requirements of this
package.

All code imported from patch-o-matic has been reviewed and all
apparent bugs like binary stability across multiarches, missing
sanity checks and incorrect endianess handling have been fixed,
simplified, and sped up.


Included in this package
========================
- xt_ACCOUNT 1.16, libxt_ACCOUNT 1.3


Inclusion into a kernel tree
============================




External extensions
===================

The program "xa-download-more" can be used to download more
extensions from 3rd parties into the source tree. The URLs are listed
in the "sources" file. If the "sources" file contains an entry like

	http://foobar.org/xa/

xa-download-more will inspect http://foobar.org/xa/xa-index.txt for
files to download. That file may contain

	foobar.tar.bz2

and xa-download-more will then retrieve and unpack
http://foobar.org/xa/foobar.tar.bz2.

Files that should be contained in the tarball are an mconfig and
Kbuild files to control building the extension, libxt_foobar.c for
the userspace extension and xt_foobar.c for the kernel extension.

	mconfig.foobar
	extensions/Kbuild.foobar
	extensions/Mbuild.foobar
	extensions/libxt_foobar.c
	extensions/libxt_foobar.man
	extensions/xt_foobar.c
	extensions/xt_foobar.h
