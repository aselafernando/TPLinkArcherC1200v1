The extra files you will need is the binary database files. They are generated
from a country-subnet database with the geoip_build_db.pl tool that is shipped
with the source package, and which should be available in compiled packages in
/usr/lib(exec)/xtables-addons/. The first command retrieves CSV files from
MaxMind, while the other two build packed bisectable range files:
.PP
mkdir -p /usr/share/xt_geoip; cd /tmp; $path/to/xt_geoip_dl;
.PP
$path/to/xt_geoip_build -D /usr/share/xt_geoip GeoIP*.csv;
.PP
The shared library is hardcoded to look in these paths, so use them.
