Causes confusion on the other end by doing odd things with incoming packets.
CHAOS will randomly reply (or not) with one of its configurable subtargets:
.TP
\fB\-\-delude\fP
Use the REJECT and DELUDE targets as a base to do a sudden or deferred
connection reset, fooling some network scanners to return non-deterministic
(randomly open/closed) results, and in case it is deemed open, it is actually
closed/filtered.
.TP
\fB\-\-tarpit\fP
Use the REJECT and TARPIT target as a base to hold the connection until it
times out. This consumes conntrack entries when connection tracking is loaded
(which usually is on most machines), and routers inbetween you and the Internet
may fail to do their connection tracking if they have to handle more
connections than they can.
.PP
The randomness factor of not replying vs. replying can be set during load-time
of the xt_CHAOS module or during runtime in /sys/modules/xt_CHAOS/parameters.
