The "ipv4options" module allows to match against a set of IPv4 header options.
.TP
\fB\-\-flags\fP [\fB!\fP]\fIsymbol\fP[\fB,\fP[\fB!\fP]\fIsymbol...\fP]
Specify the options that shall appear or not appear in the header. Each
symbol specification is delimited by a comma, and a '!' can be prefixed to
a symbol to negate its presence. Symbols are either the name of an IPv4 option
or its number. See examples below.
.TP
\fB\-\-any\fP
By default, all of the flags specified must be present/absent, that is, they
form an AND condition. Use the \-\-any flag instead to use an OR condition
where only at least one symbol spec must be true.
.PP
Known symbol names (and their number):

Examples:
.PP
Match packets that have both Timestamp and NOP:
\-m ipv4options \-\-flags nop,timestamp
.PP
~ that have either of Timestamp or NOP, or both:
\-\-flags nop,timestamp \-\-any
.PP
~ that have Timestamp and no NOP: \-\-flags '!nop,timestamp'
.PP
~ that have either no NOP or a timestamp (or both conditions):
\-\-flags '!nop,timestamp' \-\-any
