This module matches certain packets in P2P flows. It is not
designed to match all packets belonging to a P2P connection \(em
use IPP2P together with CONNMARK for this purpose.
.PP
Use it together with \-p tcp or \-p udp to search these protocols
only or without \-p switch to search packets of both protocols.
.PP
IPP2P provides the following options, of which one or more may be specified
on the command line:
.TP
\fB\-\-edk\fP
Matches as many eDonkey/eMule packets as possible.
.TP
\fB\-\-kazaa\fP
Matches as many KaZaA packets as possible.
.TP
\fB\-\-gnu\fP
Matches as many Gnutella packets as possible.
.TP
\fB\-\-dc\fP
Matches as many Direct Connect packets as possible.
.TP
\fB\-\-bit\fP
Matches BitTorrent packets.
.TP
\fB\-\-apple\fP
Matches AppleJuice packets.
.TP
\fB\-\-soul\fP
Matches some SoulSeek packets. Considered as beta, use careful!
.TP
\fB\-\-winmx\fP
Matches some WinMX packets. Considered as beta, use careful!
.TP
\fB\-\-ares\fP
Matches Ares and AresLite packets. Use together with \-j DROP only.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fP
Prints some information about each hit into kernel logfile. May 
produce huge logfiles so beware!
.PP
Note that ipp2p may not (and often, does not) identify all packets that are
exchanged as a result of running filesharing programs.
.PP
There is more information on http://ipp2p.org/ , but it has not been updated
since September 2006, and the syntax there is different from the ipp2p.c
provided in Xtables-addons; most importantly, the \-\-ipp2p flag was removed
due to its ambiguity to match "all known" protocols.
