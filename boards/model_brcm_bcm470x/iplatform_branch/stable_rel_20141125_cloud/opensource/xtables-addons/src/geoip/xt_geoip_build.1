.SH Description
.PP
xt_geoip_build is used to build packed raw representations of the range
database that the xt_geoip module relies on. Since kernel memory is precious,
much of the preprocessing is done in userspace by this very building tool. One
file is produced for each country, so that no more addresses than needed are
required to be loaded into memory. The ranges in the packed database files are
also ordered, as xt_geoip relies on this property for its bisection approach to
work.
.PP
Input is processed from the listed files, or if none is given, from stdin.
.PP
Since the script is usually installed to the libexec directory of the
xtables-addons package and this is outside $PATH (on purpose), invoking the
script requires it to be called with a path.
.PP Options
.TP
\fB\-D\fP \fItarget_dir\fP
Specify a target directory into which the files are to be put.
.SH Application
.PP
Shell commands to build the databases and put them to where they are expected:
.PP
xt_geoip_build -D /usr/share/xt_geoip
